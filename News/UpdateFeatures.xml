    <content>Some new features added:
Sort by tech - Allows sorting based on techlevel of apparel
Armor-value option - Allows setting the armor value of apparel to be sorted under the Armored category
The sort-options can also be combined so it is possible for example to sort by layer first, then tech
Please leave a comment on the mod-page if you have an idea of more sorting-options!
